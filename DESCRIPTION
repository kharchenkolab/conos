Description: Wire together large collections of single-cell RNA-seq datasets. The package focuses on uniform 
  mapping of homologous cell types across heterogeneous sample collections. For instance, a collection of 
  dozens of peripheral blood samples from cancer patients, combined with dozens of controls. And perhaps also 
  including samples of a related tissue, such as lymph nodes.
