\title{performs a greedy top-down selective cut to optmize modularity}
\usage{
greedy.modularity.cut(wt, N, leaf.labels = NULL, minsize = 0,
  minbreadth = 0, flat.cut = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{wt}{walktrap rsult}

\item{N}{number of top greedy splits to take}

\item{leaf.labels}{leaf sample label factor, for breadth calculations - must be a named factor containing all wt$names, or if wt$names is null, a factor listing cells in the same order as wt leafs}

\item{minsize}{minimum size of the branch (in number of leafs)}

\item{minbreadth}{minimum allowed breadth of a branch (measured as normalized entropy)}

\item{flat.cut}{whether to simply take a flat cut (i.e. follow provided tree; default=TRUE). Does no observe minsize/minbreadth restrictions}
}
\value{
list(hclust - hclust structure of the derived tree, leafContent - binary matrix with rows corresponding to old leaves, columns to new ones, deltaM - modularity increments)
}
