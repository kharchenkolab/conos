\title{Establish rough neighbor matching between samples given their projections in a common space}
\usage{
getNeighborMatrix(p1, p2, k, k1 = k, matching = "mNN", metric = "angular",
  l2.sigma = 1e+05, cor.base = 1, min.similarity = 1e-05)
}
\arguments{
\item{p1}{projection of sample 1}

\item{p2}{projection of sample 2}

\item{k}{neighborhood radius}

\item{matching}{mNN (default) or NN}

\item{metric}{distance type (default: "angular", can also be 'L2')}

\item{l2.sigma}{L2 distances get transformed as exp(-d/sigma) using this value (default=1e5)}

\item{min.similarity}{minimal similarity between two cells, required to have an edge}
}
\value{
matrix with the similarity (!) values corresponding to weight (1-d for angular, and exp(-d/l2.sigma) for L2)
}
