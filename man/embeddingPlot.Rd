  alpha = 0.4, size = 0.8, title = NULL, plot.theme = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{embedding}{two-column matrix with x and y coordinates of the embedding, rownames contain cell names and are used to match coordinates with groups or colors}

\item{groups}{vector of cluster labels, names contain cell names}

\item{colors}{vector of numbers, which must be shouwn with point colors, names contain cell names. This argument is ignored if groups are provided.}

\item{plot.na}{plot points, for which groups / colors are missed (TRUE / FALSE)}

\item{min.cluster.size}{labels for all groups with number of cells fewer than this parameter are considered as missed. This argument is ignored if groups aren't provided}

\item{mark.groups}{plot cluster labels above points}

\item{show.legend}{show legend}

\item{alpha}{opacity level [0; 1]}

\item{size}{point size}

\item{title}{plot title}

\item{plot.theme}{theme for the plot}

\item{palette}{function, which accepts number of colors and return list of colors (i.e. see colorRampPalette)}

\item{color.range}{controls range, in which colors are estimated. Pass "all" to estimate range based on all values of "colors", pass "data" to estimate it only based on colors, presented in the embedding. Alternatively you can pass vector of length 2 with (min, max) values.}

\item{font.size}{font size for cluster labels. It can either be single number for constant font size or pair (min, max) for font size depending on cluster size}

\item{show.ticks}{show ticks and tick labels}

\item{legend.position}{vector with (x, y) positions of the legend}

\item{legend.title}{legend title}

\item{raster}{should layer with the points be rasterized (TRUE/ FALSE)? Setting of this argument to TRUE is useful when you need to export a plot with large number of points}

\item{raster.width}{width of the plot in inches. Ignored if raster == FALSE.}

\item{raster.height}{height of the plot in inches. Ignored if raster == FALSE.}

\item{raster.dpi}{dpi of the rasterized plot. Ignored if raster == FALSE.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed on to \code{ggrepel::geom_label_repel}
\describe{
  \item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2]{aes}} or
\code{\link[ggplot2]{aes_}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the
default), is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the
plot. You only need to supply \code{mapping} if there isn't a mapping
defined for the plot.}
  \item{data}{A data frame. If specified, overrides the default data frame
defined at the top level of the plot.}
  \item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this
layer, as a string.}
  \item{parse}{If TRUE, the labels will be parsed into expressions and
displayed as described in ?plotmath}
  \item{box.padding}{Amount of padding around bounding box, as unit or number.
Defaults to 0.25. (Default unit is lines, but other units can be specified
by passing \code{unit(x, "units")}).}
  \item{label.padding}{Amount of padding around label, as unit or number.
Defaults to 0.25. (Default unit is lines, but other units can be specified
by passing \code{unit(x, "units")}).}
  \item{point.padding}{Amount of padding around labeled point, as unit or
number. Defaults to 0. (Default unit is lines, but other units can be
specified by passing \code{unit(x, "units")}).}
  \item{label.r}{Radius of rounded corners, as unit or number. Defaults
to 0.15. (Default unit is lines, but other units can be specified by
passing \code{unit(x, "units")}).}
  \item{label.size}{Size of label border, in mm.}
  \item{segment.colour}{Colour of the line segment. Defaults to the same colour
as the text. In the unlikely event you specify both US and UK spellings of colour, the
US spelling will take precedence.}
  \item{segment.color}{Colour of the line segment. Defaults to the same colour
as the text. In the unlikely event you specify both US and UK spellings of colour, the
US spelling will take precedence.}
  \item{segment.size}{Width of line segment connecting the data point to
the text label, in mm.}
  \item{segment.alpha}{Transparency of the line segment. Defaults to the same
transparency as the text.}
  \item{min.segment.length}{Skip drawing segments shorter than this, as unit or
number. Defaults to 0.5. (Default unit is lines, but other units can be
specified by passing \code{unit(x, "units")}).}
  \item{arrow}{specification for arrow heads, as created by \code{\link[grid]{arrow}}}
  \item{force}{Force of repulsion between overlapping text labels. Defaults
to 1.}
  \item{max.iter}{Maximum number of iterations to try to resolve overlaps.
Defaults to 2000.}
  \item{nudge_x}{Horizontal and vertical adjustments to nudge the
starting position of each text label.}
  \item{nudge_y}{Horizontal and vertical adjustments to nudge the
starting position of each text label.}
  \item{xlim}{Limits for the x and y axes. Text labels will be constrained
to these limits. By default, text labels are constrained to the entire plot
area.}
  \item{ylim}{Limits for the x and y axes. Text labels will be constrained
to these limits. By default, text labels are constrained to the entire plot
area.}
  \item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE} (the default), removes missing values with
a warning.  If \code{TRUE} silently removes missing values.}
  \item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}
  \item{direction}{"both", "x", or "y" -- direction in which to adjust position of labels}
  \item{seed}{Random seed passed to \code{\link[base]{set.seed}}. Defaults to
\code{NA}, which means that \code{set.seed} will not be called.}
  \item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2]{borders}}.}
